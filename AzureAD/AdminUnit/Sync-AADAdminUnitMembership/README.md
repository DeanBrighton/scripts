 | Object Type | Supported Attributes | 
 | Administrative Unit | displayName | 
 | Group | displayName <br /> mail |

## Setup Azure AD Authentication

The script uses Azure AD App Registration and certificate authentication so that it can be set up as a scheduled task and run on a schedule.

To set up the authentication for this script you will need a certificate (which can be self signed, in the certificate store of the user account running the task). 

### Step 1. Create app registration

Follow the steps in [Option 1: Upload a certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-1-upload-a-certificate)

Update the script parameters:
 - **CertificateThumbprint** - The thumbprint of the certificate

### Step 4. Add API permissions
